## 1) Main Design Challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
###### The main function of https://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/wp/ is to offer an efficient and convenient way to find out about and enroll in classes offered during a semester. For those interested in pursuing an education, this will make the process of enrollment less tedious and more accessible so the user can better focus on things of primary importance, like the content of their classes of interest, and the compatibility with the user's schedule.
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
###### This purpose serves to satisfy the basic need of self actualization, as the website aids in adding ease to the process of purusing an education for those who decide to sign up for classes. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
###### The traditional (although it has long since been updated to be more tech-saavy) solution to satisfy these needs is to visit the institution or mail enrollment application to the institution, as well as looking for the classes offered that quarter in a physical catalogue (this is still a current solution.). Berkeley City College does offer online enrollment, but is extremely difficult to navigate, according to a small pool of reports coming from 15 UC Berkeley students.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology
###### Besides the fact that online communication is generally much faster and efficient compared to traditional methods (thus speeding up the process of receiving and sending applications to enroll), searching for classes to enroll in as well as finding information about specific classes is much more efficient in an online setting because it offers features like using related terms to search for classes instead of traversing the catalogue by subject or class title.
## 2) Target users 
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
###### The general demographic of users are people aged above the typical age of a high schooler. Community college (CC) is a non traditional format of school that is often taken advantage of by non traditional students (eg. high school students go to cc for more challenging curriculum, older students turn to community college as an accessible way to obtain a degree past the typical point in life for school enrollment, and lastly, many students decide to go to cc instead of a four year).
###### Preference of users would be money and time efficiency; cc caters to those who are short on money and time.
###### No expertise should be required to use this feature.
### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
###### Both the act of enrolling and searching for classes should be easily accessible from anywhere. The idea is to not limit where users can complete this activity.
### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
###### To find classes, users would traverse through a comprehensive catalogue of the courses offered during a semester, or they would use keywords and department abbreviations (eg. DH, PHILOS, PSYCH) to find courses in a search engine-like platform. To enroll, users would submit an online application containing relevant fields of information about them, or do the same on a physical application, mailing it in instead.
