### Features
*** 
##### Main page for generic drug name, with brand names nested within.
###### For example, main page for methylphenidate would contain Adderall, Ritalin, etc. This page would also show up if any of the nest names were the key termed used to search.
##### Page should lead to online retailers. 
###### This may be a bit out of the scope of the use of the site, but the customers should at least be able to see all online retailers on one page to then compare their prices and locations.
##### Mixed drug effects and side effects
###### Must prioritize the potential adverse effects of mixing drugs. Primary feature should display whether the medicine can be taken while drinking or smoking marijuana, and all other brand names that it clashes with.
