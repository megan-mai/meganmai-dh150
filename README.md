### Goal 
I aim to redesign the goodreads homepage and the Velvetyne full-view font page. Specifically, the goodreads page need to be simplified/modularized. There is too much information conveyed all at once on one page; there are more options than any user would need to see all at once. There should be only a few navigation options that would encapsluate other options (logically categorized). On the other hand, velvetyne's page needs a more straightfoward navigation for the full-view of the font. It is not clear what the user needs to do to download the font, edit the example text, or view the text in full.

### Description
Goodreads is a book tracker/online bookclub social media platform. It is a way for users to track their progress and find new reads. 
### Overall Evaluation
As pictured above, there are many seasonal events and features that are on display at all times on every page for the user to see. Despite it's consistent presence, I believe this may spur users to actively ignore these often unwarranted suggestions. Additionally, options to plan a reading list, update your profile on what you are reading, and a list of books in progress are also displayed on the same page. 
### Heuristic Evaluation
The first and primary violation is in regards to the heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design. The page is flooded with extraneous and non-vital information. There are several seasonal events that could be allocated under one tab, as well as the option to plan, update, and list any reads.
