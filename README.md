### Goal 
I aim to redesign the goodreads homepage and the Velvetyne full-view font page. Specifically, the goodreads page need to be simplified/modularized. There is too much information conveyed all at once on one page; there are more options than any user would need to see all at once. There should be only a few navigation options that would encapsluate other options (logically categorized). On the other hand, velvetyne's page needs a more straightfoward navigation for the full-view of the font. It is not clear what the user needs to do to download the font, edit the example text, or view the text in full.
