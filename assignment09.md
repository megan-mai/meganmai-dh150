# Assignment 08: Pitch
1) My name is Megan Mai, and my project is the simplification of the Berkeley City College.
2) The aim of my project is to minimalize the BCC website. While the technical uses for the website vary greatly, I identified three features I believe to take prescendence over all the others that appeared, on the original website to have not been visual prioritized over other, arguably more trivial features.
The features are: navigation to enrollment page, news, and navigating the resources board.
3) The primary issue with the colleges' website is clutter and excessive information. More specifically, however, the website presented excessive amounts of options on each page at a time, which can be advantageous as users are likely to find what they are looking for somewhere on the same page. However, I thought consolidating options would greatly benefit the user's experience. I noted during user testing that the subject was rushed and erratic; rapidly flicking from top to bottom of the page in an attempt to find what she was looking for. For the more patient, the information overload may not be as harmful. But certainly simplifying the process would do no harm to either party.
Ultimately, I wanted to streamline the user's navigation; so instead of letting the user traverse a page filled with all features possible, I wanted to create an experience where users are guided through a process that intuitively provides the most relevant navigation options. This way, the user has a slightly tailored experience, and seldom is led astray in the process of attempting to find something on the page.
4) The [homepage of the website](https://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/wp/)is quite busy. It is partitioned into several sections, with a header and two banners stacked atop each other, and then three more sections, each containing information and options about social media, school resources, as well as other categorically indistinguishable links. At the bottom, the page abides by a design standard and provides contact informaton and additional navigational options; like a business card. There are many paths to travel down for the user, and if one opens the page with intention of finding something, they are easily distracted. Most prominently, the page violates the tenet of minimalism and aesthetic design. The website is arguably unsightly, with lots of graphic action and large, attention-calling text clashing with each other presented visibly and unsubtly. By contrast, and in part due to this pitfall, means the website excels in the principle of recognition rather than recall. The user rarely has to memorize information when it is all laid out for them. The enrollment page uses card-like spreads to section off the tasks needed or reccomended to be completed during enrollment. This somewhat bears a real-life resemblance to the real world, where lists are sectioned onto index cards or pieces of paper. The website also offers minimal user flexibility. It tailors actions to whether the user is registered and logged in versus when they are logged out or a new student.
5) User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The subject was a student at local university with a preexisting account, but no experience attempting to enroll. I tasked her with finding her way to the enroll page, which was qualified by a page where she could press a button that added a class to her schedule. I noted during user testing that the subject was very impatient and reckless; rapidly flicking from top to bottom of the page when she didn't immediately find what she was looking for. She was very eager to click links and did not spend much time figuring out whether or not the label she had selected would lead to the results she wanted. As such, the plethora of information on the page did not serve her well, as she spent much time clicking around the wrong areas and then backtracking.
6) UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Summary and link to your assignment folder
I created three associated user personas that embodied most user types typical to the website. This included a high school student looking to enroll in a middle college program, a traditional college freshman enrolling to transfer in two years, and an already registered univeristy student looking to transfer credits.
7) Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

8) Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Based on professor feedback, 
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)
9) High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype
10) Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
11) Pitch video [update the video after recording your presentation]
12) conclusion: what you learned throughout the process
