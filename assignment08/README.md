# Redesigning the Berkeley City College website

### Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to elevate the most relevant features of a college homepage. The vast majority of users visiting the page are students or prospective students, and as such, one of the primary features to be prioritized is a the enroll- ment/application process. The enrollment process must take precedence over almost all other functions provided by page due to both its complexity and its relevance. Subsequently important features would be to access the class catalogue (this is where you would actually enroll in a class), and to enroll in a middle college program. 

### Design statement
Whether it be to search for classes for already registered students, or to apply to become a student, or to enroll in a high school level program, the enrollment feature acts as the mainline of the college page, and it is important that it is supported elegantly and is simple to navigate. The changes made to this project are inspired by feedback garnered from iterative user testing. The origin of the project stems from independent complaints from peers hailing from a considerably large and relevant user base (students attending nearby university in need of completing undergraduate credits). I based my initial low-fidelity prototype around the feedback, which ultimately cited complexity and data overstimulation on the enrollment page as the primary issue of the prototype. I implemented these ideas by nesting options within eachother instead of presenting all possible routes on the same page, and consolidated the terms 'enroll' and 'apply' under the same 'enroll' button and link, after concluding that enrollment would imply application. All of these changes were considered during the process of developing my high-fidelity prototype in adobe xd.
### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
The college enrollment and application system has long since switched entirely to a digital platform, however the varying systems of different schools differ greatly. Among large instituions like the UC systems, or smaller ones, like school districts, one will find that some modes of organization are far more effective in encouraging and easing the strain of class enrollment.
### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
I conducted a series of video interviews among different user demographics (high school, college, adult) and concluded that the primary issue with the website was excessive information on the page and cluttered, at time repetive formatting.
