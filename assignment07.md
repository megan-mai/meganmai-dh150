# Assignment 07: High Fideliy Prototype
Megan Mai / DH 150 / Spring '20
### Description
The purpose of this project is to elevate the most relevant features of a college homepage. The vast majority of users visiting
the page are students or prospective students, and as such, one of the primary features to be prioritized is a the enroll-
ment/application process. The enrollment process must take precedence over almost all other functions provided by
page due to both its complexity and its relevance. Whether it be to search for classes for already registered students, or to apply to become a student, or to enroll 
in a high school level program, the enrollment feature acts as the mainline of the college page, and it is important that 
it is supported elegantly and is simple to navigate. 
The changes made to this project are inspired by feedback garnered from iterative user testing. The origin of the project 
stems from independent complaints from peers hailing from a considerably large and relevant user base (students attending nearby university in need of completing 
undergraduate credits). I based my initial low-fidelity prototype around the feedback, which ultimately cited complexity and data overstimulation on the enrollment page
as the primary issue of the prototype. I implemented these ideas by nesting options within eachother instead of presenting all possible routes on the same page, and consolidated the terms 'enroll' and 'apply' under the same 'enroll' button and link, after concluding that enrollment would imply application.
