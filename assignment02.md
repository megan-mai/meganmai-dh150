 1) Usability testing is a vital part of evaluating the effectiveness of an interface. It is an application of the principles of UX, and is an imperative step in web design development. UT uses real participants reacting to the interface in question and analyzes their reaction and behavior while interacting with the interface to get a clear picture of the usability of the interface.
 I want to test specifically the effect of the cluttered layout of Goodreads effects the user experience, whether having so many pathways open on the homepage makes navigation easier or harder. I also wanted to test the effeciency of the main features of the website, like book purchasing, renting, book rating, and quote searching.
The primary heuristic violations were:
- highly cluttered and excessive design (not aesthetically minimal or functional)
- rigid and clunky navigation (violation of flexibility and efficiency of use)
- inability to recover from error (does not support undo redo, no confirmation messages)

3) Video will be emailed separately.

4) The testing went relatively well. The participant was extremely thorough and vocal in his evaluation, specifically detailing the confusing aspects of the website navigation, and even offering solutions from the user perspective. In an ideal time, we would not be practicing social distancing and I would have been able to conduct this interview in person. This would have helped me avoid much of the technical issues I encountered while setting up and uploading the interview.
