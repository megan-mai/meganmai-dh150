# Assignment 06: Low-fidelity Prototype

**Description**

###### The website that inspired my project was the Berkeley home page and enrollment feature. One of the primary purposes of the homepage is to direct potential students to
###### resources for enrollment. This is the aspect of the website I decided to focus my critique on.
###### The genesis of the Berkeley City College's issue with the enrollment system is excessive complexity. The research I conducted indicated that this complexity is combination of an overcrowded/busy homepage design and tedious and cyclical navigation path from home page to enrollment page.
###### I found that, given the nature of the city college system, the easiest way to lose potential students is to make the enrollment process, which is mostly done online in this age, needlessly complex and tedious. Therefore, the accessibility of the enrollment process should a priority in construction of such sites.
###### The personas I created were conceptualized to fit the ideal of the user base for the website. First, there was Alice Chen, who is a busy and impatient student at the University nearby. She needs to fufill a general requirement at one of the city colleges. Ruby is a student coming out of high school who is deciding on city colleges
###### to attend as a transferring point. She is turning to junior college as a cost effective alternative to going straight to a four year. She's busy with a full time job and prioritizes time efficiency. Lastly, Toni is a high school student looking to attend middle college during her highschool career. She is inexperienced with enrollment because she has never enrolled in anything on her own before. She also needs to apply before she enrolls.
###### There is a general feature that all of these archetypes would benefit from, and that is the simplification of the process of enrollment. It is an overarching property that both cares for time effifiency, which in turn is a subproperty of monetary wealth. It is likely lower income users have less luxury of time. Lastly, simplying the enrollment path would help inexperienced users complete what seems to a very daunting task.
